    Count the number of instances for each key in a dictionary.

        str: A string containing a count for each key in the input dictionary.

    The function takes an input dictionary where keys are identifiers and values are lists of instances.
    It counts the number of instances for each key and returns a string with the key-value pairs.

    Note:
    - The input dictionary should have keys as identifiers and values as lists of instances.
    - The function ensures that keys are treated as strings.
    - The returned string contains key-value pairs in the format "key:count," separated by a comma and space.

    The function reads the content of the specified `dictionary_file`, assuming it is a tab-separated text file
    with two columns: NER identifiers (keys) and their corresponding replacements (values).

    It constructs and returns a replacement dict where NER identifiers are mapped to lists of possible replacements.

    - If an NER identifier already exists in the dictionary, the replacement is appended to its list.
